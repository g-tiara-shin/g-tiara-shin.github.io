## Session 1. Designer brand and business

By Geonmaan Lee of "[LEE GEON MAAN](http://www.leegeonmaan.com/)"

This session was about the brand "Leegeonmaan" and the designer, Geonmaan Lee. At first, he didn't know how to set the price of his design. He made a product with his design. In order to sell it, he made his own brand eventually.

His work is inspired by Korean culture and nature. He is actively collaborating with the government sector.

He tried to make something new that didn't exist before. But after the failure, he realized that in order to make something new, you have to copy and analyze the great design first.

> If there is a will, there is a way.


## Session 2. Valuable Product Experience

by Seongho Park of "[BOUD](https://www.theboud.com/)"

Seongho Park is a UX design professional. Now he extends his area to industrial design and has his own business.

He emphasized that designers should be nice. Because design has a great power to affect the world in a various way.

People just like good design. It is an instinct. They just like it and rationalize later. Good design speaks itself without words.

Then, what makes a good design? The secret is sincerity which comes from small details.

He introduced so many interesting cases which involves great user experience; reusable coca-cola bottles, bottle cab of baby feeding spoon and so on. In addition, he shared his findings of common features of these products.  

1. Combine various elements.
2. Focusing on the nature of own.

> Collaboration is the most important thing. There is a distinct difference between what you know and what you can do. You can make anything possible with the help of others.

## Session 3. AI and Creative innovations

by Seongbong Jo of "[Right Brain](http://www.rightbrain.co.kr/)"

Right Brain is one of the top UX digital agency in Korea. At first, they were focusing on the digital product but the boundaries are extending.

Seongbong Jo introduced many cases using AI into six areas; home, office, store, mobility, field and health.

AI is highly related to data. It may not be perfect at the beginning. As it accumulates data, the accuracy will be improved. Also, by using AI, companies can easily reach their customers.

> In the end, good UX will be the key to success.

## Session 4. Data-drive creative strategies

by Sujin Lee of "[INNOCEAN Worldwide](http://www.innocean.com/ww-ko/)"

Sujin Lee works at a worldwide marketing agency.

Data affect marketing business massively. She calls data as 'the one ring'.

Still, there are a lot more rooms to improve between creative and data. However, designers should consider data as their weapon to persuade clients.

> Principles lead, rules follow. Be the guide and guardian of your customer's data. AI can do automotive works, the human can do creative works.

## Session 5. Communication Based Design

by Jiyoun Kim of "[Jiyoun Kim Studioâ„¢](http://www.jiyounkim.com/)"

Jiyoun Kim was curious why some companies can't survive, even with the best design. This session was the answer to that question.

We don't see others as they are. We see them as we are. It is hard to make everyone think the same way as what I want. It is harder when it is unclear what I want. It is the same for brands. Brands should speak one voice.

He thinks brands as friends. For instance, Apple can be a hipster, Samsung can be a gentleman and LG phone can be a guy everyone likes but don't want to date.

Branding is make these guy charming. He starts the design process by setting up a concept and keeps it consistent.

> The key to making a charming brand is speaking one voice. To keep consistency, you should have the purpose of its brand from the beginning.

## Session 6. Sharing experience

by Sabum Byun of "[Plus X Creative Partner](http://www.plus-ex.com/)"

Plus X is one of the top 10 agency in the world according to IF. They offer end to end consulting service. There are so many ways to introduce brands. It can be mobile, web, poster, news, logo, typo, people, culture and so on.

![The ways to show brands](/assets/images/brandworks.JPG)

This session was all about how they work, collaborate and where they are heading.

They are working under 10 rules.

1. Plus experience
2. Curiosity + Inquisitive
3. Empathetic + creatively rational
4. Long-lasting + Optimal
5. Articulate + Intuitive
6. Consistency

It was interesting to see the quick view of the design systems and the way they organize the files.

## Session 7. UI Enhancement in E-commerce

by Jun Lee of "[LF The Brand](https://lfthebrand.com/)"

This session was about UI enhancement by using the A/B test. By enhancing click rate by 0.4%, they raised 400 billion won profit. I didn't know that slight change could make those big difference.

He says there is argue wheater copywriting is the duty of designer or not. However, design and copywrite can't be separated.

> You have to find out what the real user want.
