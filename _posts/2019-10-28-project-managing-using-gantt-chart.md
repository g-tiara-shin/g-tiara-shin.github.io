As long as many people involved, we have to set a timeline to smartly put our energy and work efficiently. So that we can manage our own time and finish our project successfully. I used a Gantt chart for the first time in the project.

## 1. Overview

A Gantt chart is a tool for project management developed by Henry Gantt. It is a type of bar chart that shows the start and end times for each task in the project schedule. It usually breakdown the project into detailed main tasks and sub-tasks.


## 2. What was the problem

There are tones of programs which help project management. Such as Airtable, Google calender, Trello, Jira, Monday.com, Asana, Evernote, Todoist, Slack, etc. I used these programs and simply chose templates that suit best for the situations. However this time, the clients asked me to share project estimate time and schedule using excel. I didn't know what type of chart is best for the projects and started to drill it down.

## 3. How I solve it

To estimate the time needed to accomplish the goal, I need to know what things should be done, which tasks should be assigned to a certain person, how long do they take and what kind of difficulties they might pace.

First, I had a phone interview with the client.

1) What do you expect to be handed in which format,

2) in order to fit the quality you want, is there any points you are especially focusing on,

3) are you providing copies,

4) Assets needed in this project ready,

5) Do you have special concepts in your mind,

6) Who will be the contact point,

7) what is your favorite communication methods, and

8) When are you expected to live the site?


Based on the answer I've got, I could make a chart. This is all in Korean but you will get the idea.  ![so called Work Breakdown Structure](images/WBS.png)

## 4. What I've learned from it

 Making a chart is not a big deal. The real value of making this chart is for communication. To clarify and bring all the parties into the same page, I recommend having a session for this. It shouldn't have to follow the format or documentation. With this, It was much easier to communicate and meet the satisfaction of both parties.

By having this kind of agreement on schedule, we could finish the project *two weeks ealier* than it orginally expected for <u>one month</u>.
