Quick side project.


## 1. Overview
Plantbee renovates a conservotory into a cafe. They needed a logo for their business, which will use at a Coffe cup, paper bag, signs and business card. They have products made of honey. They wanted their logo to feel like elegance, but at the same time, they wanted it to be simple. It located outside of the city. Because of its location, its target customers will be families with young children.

## 2. Developing
As a primary chose salmon colour, yellow, inspired by honey and dark brown, inspired by earthy tree or soil for primary colours. To add some elegance, I used a serif font type. Using polygon shape adding radius, wanted to give the impression of a safe, lovely and happy place.

## 3. Outcome
