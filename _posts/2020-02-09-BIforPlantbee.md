Quick side project.


## 1. Overview
Plantbee renovate the greenhouse into cafe. They needed a new logo for their business. They requested logo for Coffe cup, paper bag, signs and business card.
They have products made of honey. They wanted their logo feels like elegance but at the same time, they wanted it to be simple. It located outside of the city. Because of its location, their target customers will be families with young children. 

## 2. Developing
Based on the salmon color, chose yellow, inspired by honey and chose dark browni inspired by earthy tree or soil for main colors. To add some elegance, I used serif font type. Using poligon for common shape adding radius, wanted to give impression of safe, lovely and happy place.

## 3. Outcome
