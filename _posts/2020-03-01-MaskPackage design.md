Covid-19 affect us all. I wanted to be helpful to a company making masks of ‘KF-94’. I never tried package design but pushed for the first time, and it was fun.

## 1. Overview
KF-94 masks are needed tremendously, and the factories didn’t have a package design. They sell those in a zipper bag at the beginning. In Korea, we used masks long before the Covid because of fine dust from China in winter and spring. Right after the Covid-19 hit Korea, too, many families already have masks in their houses. However, that was not enough to stay longer, and we needed more productions of them. Masks were in shortage. The government and companies moved quickly to produce more. I wanted to be helpful, and I found that one company need a quick package design for KF-94 masks.

## 2. Developing
Masks considered medical supplements, and the package should include specific information to meet the law. At the same time, the size of mask is not that big. Besides, there are tons of other brands selling the same product. It needs to be unique, informative, and attractive. People tend not to read texts when they are choosing masks. They instead choose masks based on the image and some highlights. I had no idea which font size would be suitable for this. That was the most challenging part for me. I did several variations, and these are the ones I liked among them. I became grateful for every beautiful package I used to take granted.

## 3. Outcome
