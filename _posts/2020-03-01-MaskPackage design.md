Covid-19 effect us all. I wanted to be helpful to a company making masks of 'KF-94'. I never tried package design but tried for the first time and it was actually fun.

## 1. Overview
KF-94 masks are needed tremendously and the factories didn't have a package design. They just sell those in a zipper bag at the beginning. In Korea, we used masks long before the Covid because of fine dusts coming from China in winter and spring. Right after the Covid-19 hit Korea too, many families already have masks in their houses. However, that was not enough to stay longer and we needed more productions of them. Masks were in short. Government and companies moved quickly to produce more. I wanted to be helpful too. One day, I found that one company need a quick package design for KF-94 masks. 

## 2. Developing
Maks are considered as medical supplements and the package should include certain information to meet the law. At the same time, the size of mask is not that big. Besides, there are tons of other brands selling the same product. It needs to be unique, informative, and attractive. People tend to not read texts when they choosing masks. They rather choose masks based on the image and some highlights. I had no idea which font size would be suitable for this. That was the most difficult part for me. I did several variations and these are the ones I liked among them. I became grateful for the every beautiful packages I used to take granted.

## 3. Outcome
