## 1. Overview
Soyounssaem is a Korean language teacher. She is passionate for Korean education for children under 8. She wanted to launch a channel in Podcast. Specifically, she wanted to read good storybooks for children who are starting to learn Korean. Many parents are busy and don't know what is the best books for their children. Her podcasts choose a book, read and suggest extra activities which parents and children can enjoy afterwards. 

## 2. Developing
The main target is a family who has young children and there was a need to stand out among the all the other covers in the podcast. 
Most of the potcasts covers are filled with huge typos and using color red or color with high contrast. But she wanted her podcasts look more like cozy atmosphere and intrigue creativity.

As a kid, I could play just using toys like dinosaur, car, lego and dolls. So bring images from toys and find typeface to feel more like fluid. 

## 3. Outcome
Here is the outcome. Using multiple gradation of colors and texture and toys. See how it looks.
