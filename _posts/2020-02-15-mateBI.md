Quick side project.


## 1. Requirements
'mate is a startup focusing on housing management service especially small apartment for elders. They don't have an office instead they are working on their website. They need stationary to inform residents of the service they did or any news to share. They were stressing that they wanted to be seen as young enthusiastic entrepreneurs. Besides, to show what they are working, they wanted some metapore from house should be included in the logo. They asked me for Logo used for the website and stationary.

## 2. Developing
To show that they are bright, young and friendly, chose bright yellow for the main color. Their logo or typo should be used in website and stationary at the same time. For the readability, chose san-serif typeface.  

## 3. Outcome
