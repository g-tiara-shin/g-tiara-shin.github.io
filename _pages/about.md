Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Garyung Shin but you can call me Tiara.
I am from South Korea and currently lives in Barcelona, Spain.

I am a generalist who are interested in so many things. Such as cooking, gardening, fashion, Interior design, furniture, Colors, Business, finance, Yoga, travelling, culture, music, spiritual, healthy eating, nature, animals, environment, new technologies and so on. 

I can speak Korean, English and a little bit of Spanish.

With Law background, I made decisions mostly in logical way but at the same time, I follow what my instinct says. I used to work in many different industries from hospitality(cafes, bakery, convenience store, restaurants and hotel), agriculture (Vegetable farm), patent and trademark law firm, Finch startup to digital design consulting agency. I am grateful that I can have so much experience which makes my life more interesting. 

I always have a passion in beauty which leads me to UX/UI design. I love simplicity and straight forwards. I am good at organising, scheduling, and quality assurance. I feel that I am alive when I can make others life better in somehow.

These days, I am interested in Branding design, new services integrating AI, Big data and blockchain. I want to make **something** too in near future.
